# Release v0.2.0

**Released:** 2026-02-11
**Previous version:** v0.1.0

Terminal panes now support clickable links, and the release pipeline has been improved to publish richer release notes on GitHub.

## New Features

- **Clickable links in the terminal** -- URLs that appear in terminal output are now automatically detected and rendered as clickable links. Click any URL to open it directly in your default browser, no need to copy and paste.

## Improvements

- **Richer GitHub Release notes** -- New releases on GitHub now include full, human-readable changelogs instead of a generic placeholder message, making it easier to see what changed before downloading an update.
